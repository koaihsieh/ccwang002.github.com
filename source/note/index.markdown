I like Unix-like platform. I don't like Windows at all. For some reasons I still prepare the environment setup for win, but it is rather simple and serves as a makeshift. 

For windows I would prefer to setup an environment which works exactly in Unix-like platforms. So I would recommend Cygwin.

## Environment Setup

* [Mac][macenv]
* [Win][winenv]

[macenv]: /note/macenv
[winenv]: /note/winenv


## Git
* [here][git]

[git]:/note/git

## R

## Perl

## Python
* [here][python]

[python]: /note/python
