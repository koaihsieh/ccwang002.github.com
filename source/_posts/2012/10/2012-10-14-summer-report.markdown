## Structure

### Main goal
* find novel miRNAs using mirDeep2
<!-- more -->
 
### mirDeep2
* tool for identifying novel miRNAs. 
* 

### Galaxy
* Introduction
    * a data-integration and analysis framework for bioinformation research.
    * introduced by UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
    * flexibility. It is capable of combining nearly all the tools that run from command line.
* Benefits
    * History management
    * Dataset management
    * online, multi-user platform
    * Workflow design
    * Graphical interface and visual results
* Great platform for analyzing NGS data
    * they are large(around few hundreds MB to 1GB each run)
    * long computing-time consuming (even needs days to compute using high computing power like)
