## Enzyme Responsive Material
* Biomater Sci, 2013

## Evolvable/Adaptive Matter
* Building blocks
* recombine info rich seq(ex peptide)
* seq express diff functions
* selections
* responsive to environments

## Amino acid - coolest lego bricks in bio
* self assembly
* molecular recognition 
* catalysis
* minimal synthetic biology

## Minimalistic peptide self-assembly
* by control sequence of the peptide, different shapes will be self-formed.
* enviro-reponsiveness different salt affect the supermolcular structure
* self-favoured free energy choice to sequence selection
