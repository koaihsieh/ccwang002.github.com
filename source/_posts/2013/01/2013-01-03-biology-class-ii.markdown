<!-- more -->
## Amplifying DNA *in Vitro* 

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
* polymerase chain reaction (PCR, 聚合酶 連鎖反應)
* A three-step cycle
    * heating (denaturation)
        * DNA 兩股分離
    * cooling (annealing)
        * primer 接上 one strand of DNA
    * replication (extension)

## DNA cloning
* application. let us study gene's
    * sequence
    * expression 
    * function

### Gel Electrophoresis (膠體電泳）
* use gel as a molecular sieve(篩子) to separate nucleic acids or proteins by size
* molecules are sorted into “bands” by their size
* DNA 帶負電
* restriction fragment analysis
    * DNA fragments made by restriction enzyme
    * sorted by gel electrophoresis
    * compare two different DNA. ex, two alleles for a gene
        * refer to pic in P.8
    * used as gel extraction
        * prepare pure samples of individual DNA fragment
        
### Southern Blotting (南方墨點)
* technique combines gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments with nucleic acid hybridization
* specific DNA fragment can be identified
    * use labeled probes will be immobilized on a blot(墨點) of gel if it hybridizes to the DNA
    
## NGS, Next Generation Sequencing
### History
* Sanger Sequencing (1<sup>st</sup> generation sequencing)
* Human Genome Project
    * whole genome shotgun sequencing
* NGS (2<sup>nd</sup> generation sequencing)
    * Roche 454
    * Illumina Solexa Genome Analyzer (GA)
    * ABi SOLiD
    * Helicos Heliscope
* 3<sup>rd</sup> generation sequencing
    * Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT)

### Methods
FYI: [中文介紹](http://www.labmed.org.tw/UpFiles/Issues/201076111035.pdf)  

* Pyrosequencing: 454 life sciences (Roche)
    * Emulsion PCR
    * 較長的讀取長度
    * 其主要缺點則在於無法準確量測單一鹼基重複序列的長度
* Sequencing by synthesis: Solexa (Illumina) 
* Sequencing by ligation: SOLiD (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection) (ABI)

## Analyzing Gene Expression
* Nucleic acid probes can hybridize with mRNAs transcribed from a gene
* Changes in the expression of a gene can be tested using
    * Northern blotting (北方墨點)
    * RT-PCR = Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
* Compare mRNA from different developmental stages

### Northern blotting

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Northern_Blot_Scheme.PNG)

* gel electrophoresis of mRNA \+ hybridization with a probe on a membrane
* Identification of mRNA

### RT-PCR = Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ###

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c2/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction.jpg)

* quicker and more sensitive
* Reverse transcriptase: mRNA to cDNA, served as a template for PCR amplification
* products are run on a gel, identified mRNA of interest

### Hybridization or high-throughput sequencing
* microarray
    * advantage
        * specific binding
    * disadvantage
        * rely on the existing knowledge
        * cross hybridization
        * platform difference
* NGS
    * advantage
        * *De novo* analysis
        * high resolution
    * disadvantage
        * affected by library size effect
        * platform difference
    
## Determining Gene Function
* disable the gene and watch consequences
* using ***in vitro*** **mutagenesis**, alter the gene function
* also be silenced by **RNA interference (RNAi)**
    * RSIC will bind on mRNA, let mRNA degraded
    
## Genetic Markers and Disease

### Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, 單核 苷酸多型性)
* single bp stie vary in a population
* restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP ,限制片段長度多型性)

## Cloning Animals: Nuclear Transplantation (細胞移植)
* the nucleus of an unfertilized egg cell or zygote is replaced with the nucleus of a differentiated cell
* the older the donor nucleus, the lower the percentage of normally developing tadpoles
*  Dolly’s premature death in 2003, possibly reflecting incomplete reprogramming of the original transplanted nucleus
*  Cloned animals do not always look or behave exactly the same

### Problems
*  only a small percentage of cloned embryos have developed normally to birth
*  Many epigenetic changes must be reversed in the nucleus from a donor animal in order for genes to be expressed or repressed appropriately for early stages of development

## Stem Cell
* stem cell is a relatively unspecialized cell that can reproduce itself indefinitely and differentiate into specialized cells of one or more types
* embryonic stem cells (胚胎幹細胞)
    * isolated from early embryos at the blastocyst(囊胚) stage
    * these are able to differentiate into all cell types
* adult body also has stem cells
* iPS
    * induced pluripotent cells,誘導性多功能幹細胞
    * transform skin cells into ES cells by using viruses to introduce stem cell master regulatory genes
    
## Human Gene Therapy (基因治療)
* alteration of an afflicted individual’s genes
* Vectors are used for delivery of genes into specific types of cells
    * insert RNA version of normal allele into retrovirus
    * retrovirus infect target cells
    * viral DNA carrying normal allele inserts to chromosome
    
## ￼￼Pharmaceutical Products
* Protein Production in Cell Culture
    * Host cells in culture can be engineered to secrete a protein as it is made
    * the production of insulin, human growth hormones, and vaccines
* Protein Production by “Pharm” Animals
    * Transgenic animals are made by introducing genes from one species into the genome of another animal
    
## ￼￼￼￼Forensic evidence and Genetic profiles
* can be obtained by analysis of tissue or body fluids
* provide evidence in criminal and paternity
* genetic profile can be analyzed using RFLP analysis by Southern blotting
* genetic marker: short tandem repeats (STRs, 短序重複序列)
    * which are variations in the number of repeats of specific DNA sequences
